## Customization Tips

1. **Remove unused sections** - Don't include irrelevant tables
2. **Adjust weights** - Change criteria weights based on context
3. **Add visual elements** - Use emojis, tables, bullet points liberally
4. **Quantify where possible** - Numbers beat adjectives
5. **Include owners** - Every action needs an owner
6. **Set dates** - Every milestone needs a deadline
7. **Review and iterate** - Templates are starting points, not prisons
