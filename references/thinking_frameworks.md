## 1. Munger's Multiple Mental Models (芒格多元思维模型)

**Origin:** Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway

**Core Principle:** Use multiple lenses from different disciplines to analyze problems. No single model explains everything.

**Key Models to Combine:**
- **Compounding** - Small gains accumulate exponentially
- **Margin of Safety** - Build buffers for uncertainty
- **Inversion** - Solve by avoiding the opposite
- **Circle of Competence** - Know what you don't know
- **Opportunity Cost** - Every choice has a trade-off

**Application:** When facing complex decisions, explicitly apply 3-4 different models and look for converging insights.

**Example:** Analyzing an investment? Use compounding (growth potential), margin of safety (downside protection), AND inversion (how could this fail?).

## 2. First Principles Thinking (第一性原理)

**Origin:** Aristotle, popularized by Elon Musk

**Core Principle:** Break problems down to their fundamental truths and build up from there. Don't reason by analogy.

**Process:**
1. Identify current assumptions
2. Break down problem to fundamental truths
3. Build new solutions from the ground up

**When to Use:** Innovation, breaking industry norms, fundamental redesign

**Example:** SpaceX didn't accept that rockets must cost $65M. They asked: "What are rockets made of? Fuel, aluminum, titanium, copper. What do those materials cost? ~2% of the price. Why is the rest cost? Assembly and overhead. Can we change that?"

---

## 3. Inversion (逆向思维)

**Origin:** Ancient Stoic philosophy, popularized by Munger

**Core Principle:** Solve problems by considering the opposite. Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "How do I guarantee failure?" Then avoid those things.

**Formula:**
- Define your goal
- Ask: "What would guarantee NOT achieving this?"
- List all failure modes
- Systematically eliminate/prevent them

**When to Use:** Risk assessment, avoiding stupidity, safety-critical decisions

**Example:** Want to write a book? Instead of asking "How to write well?", ask "What makes books terrible?" (No structure, no editing, writing only when inspired, no accountability). Then avoid those.

## 4. Second-Order Thinking (二阶思维)

**Origin:** Howard Marks, investor

**Core Principle:** Consider not just immediate consequences, but the consequences of consequences.

**Levels:**
- **1st Order:** Direct result of an action
- **2nd Order:** Result of the 1st order result
- **3rd Order:** Result of the 2nd order result

**When to Use:** Policy decisions, complex systems, long-term planning

**Example:** City decides to reduce traffic by widening roads (1st order: more capacity). But this makes driving more attractive, increasing demand (2nd order). Result: traffic returns to original levels or worse (3rd order).

**Question to Ask:** "And then what?" - Ask it repeatedly.

---

## 5. Opportunity Cost (机会成本)

**Origin:** Economic theory

**Core Principle:** The cost of something is what you give up to get it. Every choice eliminates other choices.

**Formula:**
```
True Cost = Explicit Cost + Value of Best Foregone Alternative
```

**When to Use:** Resource allocation, time management, investment decisions

**Key Insight:** "Everything is a trade-off." If you say yes to one thing, you're saying no to everything else you could do with that time/money/attention.

**Example:** Going to grad school costs tuition PLUS 2 years of salary PLUS experience you could have gained PLUS alternative investments of that time.

## 6. Systems Thinking (系统思维)

**Origin:** Cybernetics, complexity science

**Core Principle:** See problems as interconnected systems, not isolated events. Focus on relationships, patterns, and feedback loops.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Feedback Loops:** Reinforcing (growth) vs. Balancing (stabilizing)
- **Stock and Flow:** Accumulations and rates of change
- **Leverage Points:** Small changes that produce big results
- **Emergence:** System behavior ≠ Sum of parts

**When to Use:** Complex problems, organizational change, ecological issues, social dynamics

**Tool:** Causal Loop Diagrams - Map variables and their relationships

**Example:** Company morale isn't just about salaries. It's a system involving: workload, recognition, growth opportunities, management quality, peer relationships, physical environment, autonomy. Changing one affects all others.

## 7. Golden Circle (黄金圈法则)

**Origin:** Simon Sinek

**Core Principle:** Start with WHY (purpose), then HOW (process), then WHAT (result). Most people do the reverse.

**Structure:**
- **WHY (Center):** Purpose, cause, belief. Why do you exist?
- **HOW (Middle):** Process, values, differentiation. How do you do it?
- **WHAT (Outer):** Result, product, service. What do you produce?

**When to Use:** Strategy, messaging, decision alignment, motivation

**Key Insight:** People buy WHY you do it, not WHAT you do. Decisions aligned with core purpose are more sustainable.

**Example:** Apple doesn't say "We make great computers" (WHAT). They say "We challenge the status quo" (WHY). This attracts believers who then buy computers (WHAT) as an expression of that belief.

## 8. Six Thinking Hats (六顶思考帽)

**Origin:** Edward de Bono

**Core Principle:** Parallel thinking - Look at a problem from 6 different angles, one at a time.

**The Hats:**
- **White Hat:** Facts and information (neutral, objective)
- **Red Hat:** Emotions and intuition (feelings, hunches)
- **Black Hat:** Caution and criticism (risks, problems)
- **Yellow Hat:** Optimism and benefits (value, advantages)
- **Green Hat:** Creativity and alternatives (new ideas, possibilities)
- **Blue Hat:** Process control (meta-thinking, summaries)

**When to Use:** Group decision-making, ensuring all perspectives considered, breaking deadlock

**Process:** Everyone wears same hat at same time, then switches. Prevents argument and ensures completeness.

**Example:** Product decision:
- White: What data do we have?
- Red: How do customers feel?
- Black: What could go wrong?
- Yellow: What's the upside?
- Green: What other approaches exist?
- Blue: What's our decision?

## 9. OODA Loop

**Origin:** John Boyd, military strategist

**Core Principle:** Decision cycle speed determines competitive advantage. Iterate faster than opponents.

**The Loop:**
- **Observe:** Gather information about environment
- **Orient:** Analyze and synthesize (filters: cultural traditions, genetic heritage, new information, previous experiences)
- **Decide:** Select course of action
- **Act:** Execute decision
- **→ Repeat:** Feedback feeds into new observation

**When to Use:** Competitive situations, fast-moving environments, agile decisions

**Key Insight:** "He who can handle the quickest rate of change survives." It's not about perfect decisions; it's about faster learning cycles.

**Example:** Fighter pilots use OODA to outmaneuver opponents. Startup product development: observe users, orient (analyze data), decide (what to build), act (ship), repeat.

---

## 10. SCAMPER Method

**Origin:** Alex Osborn ( brainstorming ), Bob Eberle ( SCAMPER )

**Core Principle:** Structured checklist for innovation and improvement. Manipulate existing ideas in 7 ways.

**The Checklist:**
- **S**ubstitute: What can be replaced? (materials, people, processes)
- **C**ombine: What can be merged? (features, purposes)
- **A**dapt: What else is like this? What can be copied?
- **M**odify: Magnify or minify? Change attributes?
- **P**ut to other uses: New contexts? Different users?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed? Simplify?
- **R**everse/Rearrange: Flip it? Change sequence? Reverse roles?

**When to Use:** Product innovation, process improvement, creative problem-solving

**Example:** Improving a coffee shop:
- Substitute: Replace baristas with robots
- Combine: Coffee + co-working space
- Adapt: Apply fast-food efficiency to coffee service
- Modify: 24/7 operation instead of business hours
- Put to other uses: Workspace for remote workers
- Eliminate: Remove menu, only serve one perfect coffee
- Reverse: Customers make their own coffee

## 11. Feynman Technique (费曼技巧)

**Origin:** Richard Feynman, Nobel physicist

**Core Principle:** True understanding means you can explain it simply. If you can't teach it to a beginner, you don't understand it.

**The 4 Steps:**
1. **Choose Concept:** Write it at top of page
2. **Teach It:** Explain in plain language as if teaching a child
3. **Identify Gaps:** Where did you get stuck? Use jargon? Go back to source
4. **Simplify:** Use analogies, diagrams, stories. Eliminate complexity

**When to Use:** Learning complex topics, identifying knowledge gaps, explaining to others

**Key Test:** Can you explain it without using technical terms the listener doesn't know?

**Example:** Explaining blockchain:
- Bad: "Distributed ledger using cryptographic hashes and consensus mechanisms"
- Good: "A shared notebook everyone can write in, but no one can erase. Everyone has a copy, and they all stay in sync. To change one page, you need agreement from most people."
